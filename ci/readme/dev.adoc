== Development

Helper commands are available via link:{relative-blob}ci/bin/cargo-wp[`+cargo wp+`] to facilitate development.
Adding link:{relative-tree}ci/bin[ci/bin] to your `+PATH+` is recommended - the provided https://direnv.net/[direnv shell] is set up to do this by default.

.Commands:
* `+cargo wp install gir+` will install the pinned https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir[GIR] version into ci/bin
** `+cargo wp install gir-files+` for the associated data required by GIR
* `+cargo wp gir+` will update the link:./src/auto[auto-generated source] for the main crate
* `+cargo wp sys gir+` will update the link:./sys/generate[sys bindings source]
* `+cargo wp todo+` will display incomplete interfaces (this is just an alias for `+gir -m not_bound+`)
* `+cargo wp fmt+` will rustfmt the codebase

=== GIR Schema

The WirePlumber GIR data is kept in link:{relative-blob}sys/generate/src/Wp-0.5.gir[Wp-0.5.gir].
A series of fixes must be applied to the upstream XML via the link:{relative-blob}ci/wp-gir-filter.sh[wp-gir-filter] script.
